# TODO Easy, Normal, Hard difficulty.
# 			Easy: Very long turnlimits.
# 			Normal: challenging turnlimits, sometimes fog
# 			Hard: turnlimits, more fog and often shroud
#				Perhaps difference in campaign start gold.

# TODO statistics - count victories and defeats, units recruited, units lost, units destroyed, level ups
#			DONE variable Info[1].defeats/victories created, they get counted
#			DONE in Niderdorla, if you go home when Helene asks the player, it is not counted as victory
#			DONE in Beichlinge you have a "statistic"-moveto-event in the keep, it shows victories, defeats and victory-ratio
