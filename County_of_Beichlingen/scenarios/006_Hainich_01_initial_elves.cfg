# Now do your own scenario. 
# - For victory fire the event "victory". There is no automatic goldbonus in case of victory! Add gold by yourself.  All non-leaders of side 1 will be put in the recalllist.
#
# - For defeat fire the event "Mydefeat". The gold of side 1 will be set back to the amount it was at the beginning of the scenario. Helene and Thietmar, as well as other leaders of side 1 if they exist, will be set back to what they were at the beginning of the scenario. All units of side 1 on the map will be killed, units in the recalllist will stay there. That is so the player can not gain something in a scenario he loses.
#
# - the variable Info is your friend! You find in there:
# 		- after invoking {KL_PLAYER_STRENGTHLEVEL} you find the average level of the players units in Info[0].strengthlevel
# 		- For sides 1:
#					Info[1].gold the amount of gold side 1 started the scenario with.
# 				Info[1].leader an array of the leaders the side started with. 
# 				Info[1].recalllist an array of all the units that were in the recalllist at the beginning of the scenario.
