You see, the mountain is rich with ores, minerals and gemstones - for centuries the dwarves mined and the humans traded the treasures of the Reihersberg giving both races a good living. But there is more to it - the Reihersberg has always been a magical place too! Many strange things have been witnessed here, like odd creatures and arcane phenomena that even the oldest magi don't understand. 
The most mysterious is the constant regeneration of the mountain itself. The dwarves have mined the rocks since the beginning of known history, they drilled countless tunnels and shafts, but once they abandon them the stones start to grow back and after a wile the rock that had been hacked and blown away is as massive as ever before. Also there are many caves that appear to be natural, but they change their shape and location. One day there is a cavern with a clear underground lake, the next day it is filled with hot lava or a bottomless chasm took it's place, if you fall asleep you may even find yourself walled in when you wake up. Yes, it is as if the mountain is alive, breathing and growing. Beware the mysteries of this ancient peak."

A constant darkness has fallen over the land and a foul mist streams out of the depths containing dreadful sounds and evil creatures. The water from the mountain springs, once fresh and crystal clear, has become green and turbid. A magic barrier has blocked every tunnel into the mountain just a few feet in, cutting the dwarves off from the surface - no one has seen any of them for months, it is unclear if they are even still alive. The human villages have been menaced by ghosts, pestilence and all sorts of sorrow. Even we trees suffer from the lack of sunlight ... this land is dying. Is it because the Reihersberg has fallen ill or is the mountain finally sick of all the mining and wants to stop it forever? Or is some evil force behind it?"

Some form of evil is infesting the depths of this ancient mountain, protecting itself with a magical barrier. Destroying the guardians on the outside is all we  should do! I recommend leaving a force to deal with creatures coming out of the Reihersberg so the evil force is contained, but don't attempt to break in. Anyway, to break the barrier we would need a scholar of the black magic like a Dark Adept.

# Now do your own scenario. 
# - For victory fire the event "victory". There is no automatic goldbonus in case of victory! Add gold by yourself.  All non-leaders of side 1 will be put in the recalllist.
#
# - For defeat fire the event "Mydefeat". The gold of side 1 will be set back to the amount it was at the beginning of the scenario. Helene and Thietmar, as well as other leaders of side 1 if they exist, will be set back to what they were at the beginning of the scenario. All units of side 1 on the map will be killed, units in the recalllist will stay there. That is so the player can not gain something in a scenario he loses.
#
# - the variable Info is your friend! You find in there:
# 		- after invoking {KL_PLAYER_STRENGTHLEVEL} you find the average level of the players units in Info[0].strengthlevel
# 		- For sides 1:
#					Info[1].gold the amount of gold side 1 started the scenario with.
# 				Info[1].leader an array of the leaders the side started with. 
# 				Info[1].recalllist an array of all the units that were in the recalllist at the beginning of the scenario.
