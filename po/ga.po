"County of Beichlingen (COB) does not follow a linear campaign, but features "
"an open world concept. There are some scenarios that depend on solving "
"another first, telling a little sub-story, but if you don't want that you "
"can go with the 'simple' battle scenarios without any requirements. The two "
"main ideas behind COB were\n"
"- To break the linear story-telling which forces you to win 10 scenarios in "
"order to be able to play scenario number 11.\n"
"- To be able to do random battles like in the local-game-option in "
"multiplayer, but still be able to recall veteran units. So it is useful to "
"level units up even if you only do random battles outside a storyline.\n"
"\n"
"Important notes:\n"
"1. You can not lose nor win this campaign. You can win or lose individual "
"scenarios, but the two main characters Helene and Thietmar always survive to "
"fight another day and there will be never an 'all done'-situation. Also, on "
"this map you are save, no enemy will ever appear, so there is no need to "
"call in units.\n"
"\n"
"2. You can try a lost scenario any number of times. You can replay some of "
"the scenarios you already beat, other scenarios make way for new ones after "
"you win them.\n"
"\n"
"3. The scenarios feature adaptive difficulty - if you start with lots of "
"gold, the enemy will have lots of gold. If you are poor, the enemy is poor "
"too. If you field veteran units, the enemy will get access to veteran units "
"too. Usually, if you get a gold bonus, the enemy gets one too. This means "
"the scenarios are always fair and always challenging! Many scenarios also "
"feature random elements. So there is a high replay value.\n"
"\n"
"4. Move Helene or Thietmar to the marked tiles and chose what you wanna do. "
"There is always an option to do nothing - so there is no harm in trying a "
"new tile. <span font_size='larger'>Please read the textmessages that pop up "
"during the game carefully, they are often important - I promise I keep them "
"short and there will be no more than a maximum of three messages in a row. </"
"span> Longer texts are optional like this one and not essential to winning "
"the scenarios."
